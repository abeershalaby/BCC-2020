# Windows Instructions

# 1. Download the Reactome Graph Database from https://reactome.org/download/current/reactome.graphdb.tgz

# 2. Create the path to hold the Reactome graph database:

# a) Create a new folder called "neo4j" in any location you wish.
# b) In the "neo4j" folder, create a folder called "data"
# c) In the "data" folder, create a folder called "databases"

# 3. Move the downloaded "reactome.graphdb.tgz" file into the "neo4j/data/databases/" folder

# 4. Extract the contents of "reactome.graphdb.tgz"

# NOTE: This can be done with the command "tar -zxvf reactome.graphdb.tgz" on Windows 10 OR using a utility such as 7-Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/)

# 5. Rename the extracted folder from "reactome.graphdb.tgz" to "graph.db", if necessary

# 6. Install the Docker for Windows (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

# 7. Run the following docker command from the command line substituting the full path of the "neo4j" directory in step 2a to run the graph database

# docker run --name reactome_graph_db -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 -e NEO4J_dbms_allow__upgrade=true -e NEO4J_AUTH=none -v "C:/{path_to_neo4j_folder}:/data" neo4j:3.5.19
